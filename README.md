# SharpEnviro-Shims
Smattering of personal scripts used with SharpEnviro - Use at your own risk.

These have been modified and used between various windows versions being XP, Vista, 7, 10
They either functionally revert to older features of older versions of windows or 'shim'
  current functionality in SharpEnviro to 'generally work' without as much headache in the
  targeted OS at the time. These are not maintained and are written to my needs unless there
  is some other interest.
  
Current focus is with Windows 10 but functionality should work back on 7 as well.
