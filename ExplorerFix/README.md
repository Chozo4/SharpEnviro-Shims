Intended to revert to some preferred Win98 functionality<br><br>

When context icons are enabled in windows they only give the standard 'min/max/close' options in newer windows.<br>
-- Restores context menu on Explorer Window Icon RightClick as if the folders own context came up<br>
-- Restores backspace functionality to advance up a folder and not to the last accessed only<br>
